Abstract in kotlin

1. In kotlin an abstract class cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create object of the abstract class
2. In kotlin, the members(properties and functions) of abstract class
are non-abstract unless you explicitly use abstract keyword

Note: Abstract classes are always open. You do not need to explicitly
use open keyword to inherit subclasses from them.
